The input is a record of women who were diagnosed for Diabetes. Each line is an input point with the last value being the output.

In this case, the output is either 0 or 1. 0 means tested negative for Diabetes and 1 means otherwise.

This code can easily be converted into LWR (Locally Weighted Regression), a technique which discards the less critical (irrelevant) input points, by simply multiplying the weighting function which is given by;

w(i) = exp(-(X[i]-X)^2/(2T^2))		;; "exp" is "e^"

X[i] is the input point
X is the query point (The input for which you want to predict the output)
T (Tao) is a constant like alpha. The higher the value of Tao, the higher is the range of the input points used (chosen) for prediction or wider is the weighting function and vice-versa.

to the term "(alpha/number_inputs)*(Yi-h_theta)*(Xi[i]))" in the map function of the code.
