The input stores the two matrices to be multiplied in a file.

Each line is a row of a matrix. The first value of each row names the matrix and the last value is the row number of the matrix (starts from 0).

In this case, the first matrix is stored normally and the second matrix is stored as the transpose.

This way of storing reduces the filesize and helps the algorithm complete at a faster rate.
